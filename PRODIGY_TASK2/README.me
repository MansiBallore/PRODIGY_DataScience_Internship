# Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

## About the Project:
In this task, I performed exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival.  
The main goal was to clean the data and visualize important patterns related to age, gender, passenger class, and survival.

## Dataset Used:
https://www.canva.com/link?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FProdigy-InfoTech%2Fdata-science-datasets%2Ftree%2Fmain%2FTask%25202&design=DAFpRxy47kU&utl=h61d045f407&accessRole=viewer&linkSource=document

## Tools and Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas and NumPy  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn  

## What I Did:

### Data Cleaning
- Filled missing values in the **Age** column using the median  
- Filled missing values in the **Embarked** column using the most frequent value  
- Removed the **Cabin** column due to many missing values  

### Data Analysis and Visualization
- Visualized the number of survivors and non-survivors  
- Studied the age distribution of passengers  
- Compared survival based on:
  - Gender  
  - Passenger class  
- Analyzed relationships between numerical features using a correlation heatmap  

## Output Visualizations:
### Survival Count

### Age Distribution

### Survival by Gender

### Survival by Passenger Class

### Correlation Heatmap

## Files Included
- `Prodigy_task2.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with complete analysis  
- Output images of the visualizations shown above  

## Conclusion
This task helped me understand how exploratory data analysis can be used to discover important patterns in data.  
From the analysis, it is clear that gender, passenger class, and age played an important role in determining survival on the Titanic.

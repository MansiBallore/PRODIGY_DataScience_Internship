# Task 3 – Customer Purchase Prediction

## About the Project:
In this task, I built a machine learning pipeline to predict whether customers will make a purchase based on their demographic and banking-related features.  
The main goal was to preprocess the data, train a model, and visualize feature importance and predictions for selected test cases.

## Dataset Used:
https://www.canva.com/link?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FProdigy-InfoTech%2Fdata-science-datasets%2Ftree%2Fmain%2FTask%25203&design=DAFpRxy47kU&utl=h61d045f407&accessRole=viewer&linkSource=document
## Tools and Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas and NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn  

## What I Did:
### Data Preprocessing
- Handled categorical and numerical features  
- Prepared training and testing datasets for the model  

### Model Building
- Trained a classification model using a pipeline  
- Evaluated model accuracy on test data  

### Predictions and Testing
- Predicted outcomes for 4 specific customer inputs  
- Mapped predictions to readable labels: *Will Purchase* or *Will Not Purchase*  

### Feature Importance
- Visualized which features contributed most to the model predictions  

## Output Visualizations:
### Model Accuracy

  - `decision_tree.png`  
  - `feature_importance_plot.png`  
  - `tested_data.jpeg`  

## Conclusion
This task helped me understand how to preprocess data, build a predictive model, and visualize results.  
It also highlighted the importance of features in predicting customer behavior, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.
